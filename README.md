# OpenTrivia React App

OpenTrivia is a modern, responsive trivia quiz application built with React and Bootstrap. It allows users to select quiz categories and difficulty, answer multiple-choice questions, and track their score in real time. The app fetches questions from the Open Trivia Database API and provides instant feedback after each answer, including a final results summary.
